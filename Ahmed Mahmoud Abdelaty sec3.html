            Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly
            transport people rather than goods.
            Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.
            The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz
            Patent-Motorwagen.
            Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
            One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
            Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer
            to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world. 
            Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights.
            Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex,
            but also more reliable and easier to operate.

            <h3>The Engine </h3>
        <pre><h4>
            The heart of every car is its engine. It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems.
            Most automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand.
            A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn.
            This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down.
            They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft.
            Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. 
            The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels.</h4></pre>
        <h3>Fuel System</h3>
        <pre><h4>
            The fuel system pumps petrol from the tank to the engine.
            Older cars used to have carburetors that mix fuel with air and send the gas to the engine.
            Some cars have a special fuel injection system that sprays petrol into the engine.
            Modern cars have turbo chargers that suck in extra air and therefore create more power.

            <br><h3>History of cars</h3>
        <pre><h4>
            In the late 1770s Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, a French engineer, built a car that ran on steam.
            Many American companies also started producing them but they were very expensive to make and cost a lot of money.
            As time went on, engineers started experimenting with petrol-driven cars.
            They could travel faster and over longer distances.
            They were also safer than steam-powered models which ran with petrol
            Towards the end of the 19 th century Germany became the centre of car-making.
            Nikolaus Otto built the first internal combustion engine, Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz also began building petrol-driven engines.
